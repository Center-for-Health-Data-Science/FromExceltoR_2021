You, as a researcher, carried out a micro-array experiment with skin from 37 people in order to examine a potential association between the disease and a certain gene (IGFL4). For each of the 37 samples the gene expression was measured. Fifteen skin samples were from psoriasis patients and from a part of the body affected by the disease (psor); 15 samples were from psoriasis patients but from a part of the body not affected by the disease (psne); and 7 skin samples were from healthy people (control).\nThe data are saved in the file psoriasis.xlsx. At first the variable named type (i.e. skin sample type) is stored as a character variable, we change it to a factor (and check that indeed there are 15, 15 and 7 skin samples in the three groups).\n\n# Read in the data from Excel file and call it psoriasisData\npsoriasisData &lt;- read_excel(\"../../Data/psoriasis.xlsx\")\n\n# View the top rows of the dataset\nhead(psoriasisData)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  type  IGFL4 GeneA GeneB GeneC  GeneD GeneE GeneF GeneG   GeneH GeneI GeneJ\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 psne  0.841  2.94  3.16  4.21 -0.476  4.20 0.335  5.20  0.167   2.00  4.62\n2 psne  0.955  2.67  3.23  6.09  0.121  3.66 1.28   5.52  0.0580  2.06  4.35\n3 psne  1.07   2.53  2.80  4.48 -0.165  3.90 1.18   5.40 -0.202   1.95  2.57\n4 psne  1.11   3.56  2.53  4.97  0.139  2.92 0.744  4.98 -0.329   2.03  3.17\n5 psne  1.18   3.48  2.79  4.74 -0.102  3.04 0.513  5.48 -0.116   2.04  3.61\n6 psne  1.20   2.94  3.12  4.20 -0.200  3.46 0.472  3.95 -0.129   1.55  3.56\n\n# Extract the data of interest containing the IGFL4 expression levels and skin sample type from the dataset and call this subset psorData\npsorData  &lt;- select(psoriasisData, type, IGFL4)\n\n# View the top rows of the dataset psorData\n\n\n# Change variable named 'type' to factor so that we can use in our analysis in the next steps\n# First let's check if it is character\nis.character(psorData$type)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Now change to factor\npsorData &lt;- mutate(psorData, type = factor(type))\n# Again, let's check if it is factor now\n\n\n# Check that there are 15, 15 and 7 skin samples in the three groups.

Please share your answer here: https://www.menti.com/alhf674h4r88\n\n\nStep 2: Descriptive plots and statistics\nTo get an impression of the data, we make two plots, and compute group-wise means and standard deviations. Make (1) a plot showing three groups of skin samples (healthy, psne, psor) and IGFL4 expression levels from each skin sample so that we can visually compare each group of samples with regards to IGLF4 expression levels; (2) a boxplot for the same group-wise comparison. And finally, obtain the group-wise (healthy, psne, psor) descriptive statistics (mean, median and standard deviation). Hint: Consider using ggplot and tidyverse!\n\n# (1) a plot showing three groups of skin samples (healthy, psne, psor) and IGFL4 expression levels from each skin sample\nggplot(psorData, aes(x=type, y=IGFL4)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x=\"Skin type\", y=\"IGFL4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# (2) a boxplot for the same group-wise comparison. Hint: geom_boxplot()\n\n\n# And finally, obtain the group-wise (healthy, psne, psor) descriptive statistics (mean, median and standard deviation). Hint: group_by()\n\nQUESTION 2: Please rank the three groups by their mean/average IGFL4 expression (descending order). Just visually assess the values and write down the order of the groups. Please share your answer here: https://www.menti.com/alhf674h4r88\n\n\nStep 3: Fit of oneway ANOVA\nThe scientific question is whether the gene expression level of IGFL4 differs between the three types/groups. Thus, the natural type of analysis is a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA). The oneway ANOVA is fitted with the lm() function in R. It is a good approach to assign a name (below oneway) to the object with the fitted model. This object contains all relevant information and may be used for subsequent analysis. Note that we need to logarithmic transform the response (i.e. IGFL4 expression levels) as intensities are often on a multiplicative scale.\n\n# oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA)\noneway &lt;- lm(log(IGFL4) ~ type, data=psorData)\n\n# View the model coefficients\n\nQUESTION 3: Are you done? Please share how you feel here: https://www.menti.com/aldoypm5u6wr\n\n\nStep 4: Hypothesis test + Post hoc tests\nIt is standard to carry out an \\(F\\)-test for the overall effect of the explanatory (i.e. independent) variable. To be precise, the hypothesis is that the expected values are the same in all groups. The most easy way to do this test is to use drop1. The option test=\"F\" is needed to get the \\(F\\)-test using that function:\n\n# Carry out an $F$-test for the overall effect of the explanatory (i.e. independent) variable\n\nQUESTION 4: What is your conclusion from the \\(F\\)-test result? Please share your answer here: https://www.menti.com/ali6bnwoiky7\nIt might be that the gene expression in two of the three groups may or may not be significantly different. To investigate that we do post hoc testing. This is nicely done within the framework of estimated marginal means using the emmeans package. Here emmeans makes the estimated marginal means (that is the predicted gene expression IGFL4 on the log scale), and the pairs() command provide post hoc pairwise comparisons (package automatically adjusts for multiple comparisons using the default tukey method):\n\n# Run emmeans\nemmeans(oneway,~type)\n\n type     emmean     SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n healthy  0.2791 0.0938 34   0.0885   0.4696\n psne     0.2963 0.0641 34   0.1662   0.4265\n psor    -0.0788 0.0641 34  -0.2090   0.0513\n\nResults are given on the log (not the response) scale. \nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n# Perform post hoc pairwise comparisons\n\nQUESTION 5: What is your conclusion from the pairwise comparisons?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Except for the last two parts, this exercise is about analysis with so-called Gaussian linear models. This is the class of models where data points are assumed to be independent, Gaussian (i.e. with a normal distribution) and with the same variance. All such models are fitted with the lm function in R, like so:\nlm(y~x, data = my.data)\nThe term regression is usually used for models where all explanatory variables are numerical, whereas the term analysis of variance (ANOVA) is usually used for models where all explanatory variables are categorical (i.e. factors). However, predictors of both types can be included in the same Gaussian linear model. In the end, we are also concerned with logistic regression models (for binary outcomes e.g. cases vs. controls) and linear mixed models (for data with a block structure).\nThe purpose of this exercise is to show how to fit and work with statistical models in R. This means that the analyses are not necessarily those that should be used in a real-life analysis of the data.\nStart with the Data part. The later parts are almost independent of each other, so you can choose the parts that are most appropriate for you. However, not all statistical concepts are studied in all the parts present.\n\nData\nThe dataset to be used is about risk factors associated with low infant birth weight. The data are available in the R-package MASS (part of base R, so it is installed automatically) as a data frame called birthwt. If nothing else is mentioned, then use the infants’s birth weight, bwt, as outcome (response).\n\nUse the commands below to load the MASS package and get the help page for the data frame. The help page will appear in the lower right window of RStudio. Read about the data; in particular about the variables age, lwt, ftv, smoke, and bwt.\n\n\nlibrary(MASS)\n?birthwt\n\n\nbirthwt is not a tibble (the modern way to organize data), but we can make it one:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)    \nbirthData &lt;- as_tibble(birthwt)\nbirthData\n\n\nMother’s smoking habits (smoke) is coded as numerical variable. Make it a factor (categorical variable).\nThe ftv is a numerical variable, but we would also like a categorical version of it, with groups corresponding to zero visits, one visit, and two or more visits, respectively. Try the following commands, and check the results:\n\n\ntable(birthData$ftv)\nbirthData &lt;- mutate(birthData, ftvFac = factor(ftv))\nbirthData &lt;- mutate(birthData, visits = fct_collapse(ftvFac, Never=\"0\", Once=\"1\", other_level=\"MoreThanOnce\"))\nsummary(birthData)\n\n\nMake groupwise boxplots of bwt by visits, i.e., boxplots of birth weight for those women who did not see their doctor, those who saw their doctor once, and those who saw their doctor more than once during the first trimester - all boxplots in one graph. Do the same thing for smoke (instead of visits).\nYou may also make groupwise boxplots for each combination of smoke and visits. You add a combination term with a :, e.g. smoke:visits. What is your initial impression about potential associations?\nMake a scatterplot with lwt on the \\(x\\)-axis and bwt on the \\(y\\)-axis. Modify the plot such that points are coloured according to visits.\nModify it further such that the symbol types are different for smokers and non-smokers. This is done by adding pch=smoke.\n\n\n\nRegression\nThe term regression is usually used for models where all explanatory variables are numerical.\nIf you are not too familiar with linear regression, you can have a look at what the summary() output means here and for understanding regression plot(), have a look here.\n\nFit a linear regression model with bwt as response and lwt as covariate, and identify the estimates for the intercept and for the slope. Find the 95% confidence interval for the slope parameter by using the confint() function.\nJust by calling plot() on your regression model you made you can carry out model validation. Does the model seem appropriate for the data?\nFit the multiple linear regression model where you include lwt as well as age and ftv (numerical variables) as covariates. Identify the parameter estimates, and consider what their interpretation is.\nTry the following commands, and see if you can figure out what the outcome means. You should replace reg2 with the name of the model object from the previous question.\n\n\nnewData &lt;- data.frame(lwt=100, age=25, ftv=0)\nnewData\npredict(reg2, newData)\npredict(reg2, newData, interval=\"prediction\")\n\n\nFit the multiple linear regression model again, but now only using data from mothers with a weight less than 160 pounds (lwt &lt; 160). Hint: Use the filter function and change the data argument in the lm command.\n\n\n\nANOVA\nThe term analysis of variance (ANOVA) is usually used for models where all explanatory variables are categorical (factors). It is important that you have coded smoke as a factor, cf. Question 3.\nFirst, install and load the R-package emmeans.\n\nlibrary(emmeans)    \n\nWelcome to emmeans.\nCaution: You lose important information if you filter this package's results.\nSee '? untidy'\n\n\n\nFit the oneway ANOVA (with lm) where the expected value of bwt is allowed to differ between smokers and non-smokers. Find the estimated birth weight for infants from smokers as well as non-smokers. Is there significant difference between smokers and non-smokers when it comes to infant’s birth weight? Hints: Use summary() and the emmeans() function from the emmeans R-package. N.B make sure you know what needs to go into the function, use ?.\nFit the oneway ANOVA where you use visits as the explanatory variable. Find the estimated birth weight for each group, and make the pairwise comparisons between the groups. Furthermore, carry out the \\(F\\)-test for the overall comparison of the three levels.\nHint drop1(, test=\"F\"). What is the conclusion?\nNow, consider both visits and smoke as explanatory variables. Since they are both categorical variables (factors), the relevant model is a twoway ANOVA. Fit the twoway ANOVA model without interaction, and make sure you understand the estimates:\n\n\ntwoway1 &lt;- lm(bwt ~ visits + smoke, data=birthData)\nsummary(twoway1)\n\n\nFit the twoway ANOVA model with interaction (use the command below). Then use anova and/or drop1 to test if the interaction between visits and smoking habits is statistically significant.\n\n\ntwoway2 &lt;- lm(bwt ~ visits * smoke, data=birthData)\n\n\nYou should still use twoway2 in for this question. Use emmeans to compute the expected birth weight of infants for smokers and non-smokers, respectively, on average over the three levels of visits.\n\n\n\nModels with numerical as well as categorical predictors\nPredictors of any type can be included in Gaussian linear models, still using lm.\n\nFit a model where lwt (numeric) and smoke (factor) are included as predictors in an additive way:\n\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(bwt ~ lwt + smoke, data=birthData)\nsummary(model1)\n\nWhat is the interpretation of the estimates?\n\nFit a model with interaction between the two predictors, replacing + by a *:\n\n\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(bwt ~ lwt * smoke, data=birthData)\nsummary(model2)\n\nWhat is the interpretation of the estimates? Is there evidence in the data that the effect of mother’s weight on infant’s weight differs between smokers and non-smokers? Hint: What does the last question have to do with interaction? Use anova on appropriate models.\n\nFit the model with additive effects of mothers’s weight, smoking status, age, and visit status, and carry out model validation. Give an interpretation of the estimate associated to smoke. Does smoking affect the weight of infants?\n\n\n\nLogistic regression\nThe variable low is 1 if birth weight is less than 2500 g, and 0 if birth weight is larger than 2500g, see the plot\n\nggplot(birthData, aes(x=bwt, y=low)) + geom_point()\n\nConsider for a moment the situation where the actual birth weight (bwt) was not registered, such that low was the only information on the child. Hence, the outcome is binary (low has two values), and the relevant analysis would be a logistic regression where the probablity \\(Pr(low=1)\\) is described in terms of predictors. For example, we may consider a model with mothers’s weight, smoking status, age, and visit status as predictors, just like in the previous question.\n\nFit the model, and consider the estimates:\n\n\nlogreg1 &lt;- glm(low ~ lwt + smoke + age + visits, data=birthData, family=\"binomial\")\nsummary(logreg1)\n\nDoes this model give evidence for an effect of smoking on the weight of infants? Compare the signs of the estimates from model3 (Gaussian model in the solution for Question 18) and logreg1 (logistic regression model). Can you explain ‘what happens’?\n\n\nLinear mixed models\n\nAssume for a moment that the 189 births took place at 19 different medical centers with 10 births at each center, except for one center with only nine births. This is not the case, so we have to generate a center variable artificially. You should of course never invent such an artificial structure for a real dataset! Anyway, let’s do it like this:\n\n\nset.seed(123)\ncenter &lt;- sample(rep(1:19, each=10)[1:189])\ncenter\nbirthData &lt;- mutate(birthData,center=factor(center))\n\nThe rep command repeats the number from 1 to 19, 10 times each. We only need the first 189 numbers. The sample changes the order of the 189 numbers at random. The set.seed command has the effect that you get the same sample each time you run the commands. The last line includes the new variable in the original dataset as a categorical variable.\n\nThe center variable would typically be included in the model as a random effect. Gaussian models with both fixed and random effects are called linear mixed models, and are fitted with the lmer function from the lme4 package. Run the code below and identify relevant estimates. Remember that lme4 must be installed before the commands below can be used.\n\n\nlibrary(lme4)\nlmm1 &lt;- lmer(bwt ~ lwt + smoke + age + visits + (1|center), data=birthData)\nsummary(lmm1)",

And finally, obtain the group-wise (healthy, psne, psor) descriptive statistics (mean, median and standard deviation). Hint: Consider using ggplot and tidyverse!\n\n# (1) a plot showing three groups of skin samples (healthy, psne, psor) and GeneD expression levels from each skin sample\n\n\n# (2) a boxplot for the same group-wise comparison. Hint: geom_boxplot()\n\n\n# And finally, obtain the group-wise (healthy, psne, psor) descriptive statistics (mean, median and standard deviation). Hint: group_by()\n\nQUESTION 2: Please rank the three groups by their mean/average GeneD expression (descending order). Just visually assess the values and write down the order of the groups.\n\n\nStep 3: Fit of oneway ANOVA, model validation\nThe scientific question is whether the gene expression level of GeneD differs between the three types/groups. Thus, the natural type of analysis is a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA). The oneway ANOVA is fitted with the lm() function in R. It is a good approach to assign a name (below oneway) to the object with the fitted model. This object contains all relevant information and may be used for subsequent analysis. Note that we need to logarithmic transform the response (i.e. GeneD expression levels) as intensities are often on a multiplicative scale.\n\n# oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n\n\n# View the model coefficients\n\nQUESTION 3: Are you done? Please share how you feel with your group!\n\n\nStep 4: Hypothesis test + Post hoc tests\nIt is standard to carry out an \\(F\\)-test for the overall effect of the explanatory (i.e. independent) variable. To be precise, the hypothesis is that the expected values are the same in all groups. The most easy way to do this test is to use drop1. The option test=\"F\" is needed to get the \\(F\\)-test using that function:\n\n# Carry out an $F$-test for the overall effect of the explanatory (i.e. independent) variable\n\nQUESTION 4: What is your conclusion from the \\(F\\)-test result?\nIt might be that the gene expression in two of the three groups may or may not be significantly different. To investigate that we do post hoc testing. This is nicely done within the framework of estimated marginal means using the emmeans package. Here emmeans makes the estimated marginal means (that is the predicted gene expression GeneD on the log scale), and the pairs() command provide post hoc pairwise comparisons (package automatically adjusts for multiple comparisons using the default tukey method):\n\n# Run emmeans\n\n\n# Perform post hoc pairwise comparisons\n\nQUESTION 5: What is your conclusion from the pairwise comparisons?\nWhen done with this exercise, please write 1-2 sentences about your final conclusion(s) on the association between GeneD expression and psoriasis here (One post per group): https://ucph.padlet.org/tugcekaraderi/x8ybz5n8ilzbqnm2",
